# My Portfolio
I'm a student at <a href="https://www.wou.edu/" target="_blank">Western Oregon University</a> in the Computer Science degree program.   
This is my senior year!  Go :wolf:'s!

### About Me 
I started at <a href="https://www.chemeketa.edu/" target="_blank">Chemeketa Community College</a>, Fall Term of 2015... and graduated with an Associate/Science degree in <a href="https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/program-finder/computer-information-systems/" target="_blank">Computer Information Systems</a> after Spring term of 2017.   

Then I went to <a href="https://www.wou.edu/" target="_blank">Western Oregon University</a>, embarking on the <a href="http://www.wou.edu/cs/degrees-programs/ab-in-computer-science/" target="_blank">Applied Baccalaureate</a> degree program for <a href="http://www.wou.edu/cs/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>.

I need to say how well the CIS program at Chemeketa prepared me for everything to come at WOU!  The instructors, the coursework and labs, the experiences.   

For our senior year, all of us in the CS program -- whether regular BS or applied BS -- create this nifty portfolio showing all of our work for the year, as part of our Senior Project -- a year-long/three-term capstone course in Software Engineering:  <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/Prep.html" target="_blank">CS460</a>, CS461, and CS462.   

From the sounds of it, the first term starts us off like we're in a little red wagon at the top of a steep hill... :astonished:   
but it should be a fun ride!  :blush:

There are also lots of Sheltie photos.  And a few Collie photos.  And some silly stuff.

I don't own a smart phone, and the stupid one I *do* own, doesn't get reception when I'm home, since I live in a vortex.   
So messaging me on facebook is your best bet most of the time.  :eyes:
