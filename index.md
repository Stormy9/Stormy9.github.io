#My Portfolio
I am a student at [Western Oregon University](http://wou.edu).

###About Me (or About this Example)
This would be a good spot to say a little about yourself. And then explain a little more about why you're doing this.

Students at Western Oregon University create a Portfolio of their work during their Senior year. This is done as a part of the Senior Project, a year-long Software Engineering course (CS 460, 461 and 462).
