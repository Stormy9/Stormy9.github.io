# My Portfolio
I'm a student at <a href="https://www.wou.edu/" target="_blank">Western Oregon University</a> in the Computer Science degree program.

### About Me 
This would be a good spot to say a little about yourself. And then explain a little more about why you're doing this.

Students at Western Oregon University create a Portfolio of their work during their Senior year. This is done as a part of the Senior Project, a year-long Software Engineering course (CS 460, 461 and 462).
