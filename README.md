Hi!
As a recent graduate of Western Oregon University, with an Applied Baccalaureate of Science in Computer Science (emphasis on Software Engineering), this is an overview of the highlights of my journey and projects.  This is my second time around with college, but my first at the university level; and I finally earned a degree in my *true* passion.  

A little more *(ahem)* experienced than some of my classmates, I didn’t grow up with computers or the internet\web as a given part of daily life.  We got our first computer (an Apple IIe!) when I was 11... internet access when I was 24.  I’ve always felt like this gives me a somewhat altered — and awesome — perspective, compared to my classmates….. I still have a kind of a “sense of wonder” about things that, to them, have nearly always been ubiquitous.

I’m so happy I finally took the fork in the road that led to my Computer Science degree — I’ve finally found something I can happily work at for the rest of my life.  While enjoying the entire journey, it was during the Software Engineering Senior Sequence that I realized a shift had happened….. homework was no longer *just* homework — not just a means to a grade, or a degree — it was something I genuinely enjoyed and looked forward to getting back into after breaks for family, friends, pets, and things like sleeping and doing the dishes.

It’s true — I genuinely enjoy developing web\software applications that are smoothly functional, intuitive and enjoyable for users, aesthetically interesting, and that fulfill the project vision and mission.  Software development is an avocation that I want as my vocation as well.

I also pleasantly discovered during Senior Sequence, just how thoroughly I enjoyed working with my fun, enthusiastic, supportive, bright, and determined team — along with our Faculty Advisor\Product Owner.  The best parts of the whole experience was interacting with them while bringing our project vision to life.  Don’t get me wrong — I love our project too….. but the whole thing was made so much better by experiencing everything with my team, as part of them.  I also enjoyed interacting with classmates on other teams as we shared some technical experiences and moral support.

I’m currently looking for my first job or internship as a software developer\engineer, and hope to find a place where I can become part of an enthusiastic, determined, and talented team who delivers an awesome project while having fun working together along the way.  I know I still have some things to learn in the “real world” and am looking forward to the mentorship of such a team, as well!

I have pretty strong skills in front-end web development <i>(HTML\CSHTML + Razor, CSS, JavaScript\jQuery + AJAX & JSON, BootStrap)</i> and my skills with the back-end <i>(ASP.NET\MVC5, C#, LINQ)</i> strengthened considerably with all the practice during senior year working with my team.  

I’m also pretty good with SQL\T-SQL and relational databases, over two database courses; and have worked with noSQL databases on a few occasions in various classes as well.  Several projects had us working with API’s, and in a couple instances building our own practice API’s.

During Senior Sequence and some other classes, I became pretty comfortable using Git(Hub) via Bash, and we used Pivotal Tracker to plan and track our Senior Project following Agile Engineering methodologies.  I also wrote quite a few earlier projects in Java, especially for Data Structures and Algorithms; and while at Chemeketa learned and did projects using the LAMP stack.
