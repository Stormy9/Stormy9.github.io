## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders

Primary Stakeholder -- Katimichael Phelpedecky, swimming legend and hopeful entrepreneur

Katimichael's experience being on the US Olympic team led to an appreciation of how advanced tools can help athletes perform at their best.  The problem is those tools are very expensive and require personnel with advanced training, i.e. elite analysts for elite athletes.  They want to create a business to give regular swimming coaches, from high school, club, college, and masters, advanced analytical and predictive tools to help the athletes on their teams.  Katimichael has assembled a team of investors to fund this project and is hiring your team to create the product.

The product is centered around three core features:

1. Record, store and provide tracking, viewing and simple stats for race results for swimming athletes.  This would have a number of features found in [Athletic.net](https://www.athletic.net/), which is used for Track and Cross Country running.

<br>

2. Provide complex analysis of athlete performance over time and over different race types, to give coaches deep insight into their athlete's fitness and performance that they cannot get from their own analyses.  This includes machine learning to predict future performance based on records of past race performance, given different training scenarios.  Validation of this feature will enable the next feature.

<br>

3. Create a tool that will optimize a coach's strategy for winning a specific meet.  This feature will automatically assign athletes to specific races based on their predicted race times in order to beat an opponent coach's strategy.  There will be two modes: one in which we have no knowledge of the opponent team's performance, and one where we do have their performance and can predict their times.

### Refined Vision Statement -- Team Nerdvana

For regular or lower-division swim coaches who need the ability to analyze swimmer’s performance, the Elite Aquatics System is an information system that will provide in-depth tracking and analytics so that coaches can guide their athletes to peak performance.  The system will store race results for each athlete, so that coaches can easily access the athletic history of each swimmer; providing an intuitively easy-to-use interface for coaches to conduct complex analysis of performance by athlete and race type over time.  Historical analytics will also allow coaches to predict an athlete’s future performance, given various training scenarios.  The system will also enable coaches to develop optimal strategies to enhance their team’s odds of winning specific meets, whether or not the opposing team’s strategies are known.  This system will empower swim coaches to develop their swimmer’s skills in ways most advantageous to that swimmer, to build better swim teams overall, and to realize improved swim meet results for their team.  Unlike the current systems available to “non-elite” coaches, our product will provide elite-level analysis without the elite expense or user-training that is typical of the currently-available advanced tools of this nature.

## Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation

### Questions

1.  Are we keeping track of meets (as in, by name) and locations?
	* yes!

2.  Should coaches have “admin” status, for creating/updating/deleting their own athlete’s records?
	* ???  see #4 of “Needs & Features”

3.  Do you want to provide the images we use on your app, or should we just find some stock photos?  (for other than athlete profile photos, of course)
	* ???

4.  Non-functional Requirement #4 states:  “English will be the default language”.  Do you want to include other languages as well?
		* Eventually, but not until the app is up and smoothly running.

5.  Do you want users to be able to search\filter by factors other than athlete?  For instance, event type?
		* sure, why not?

6.  Should athletes be able to create and manage their own personal profile pages?
		* another answer

7.  Should coaches be able to create and manage their own personal profile pages?
		* another answer

8.  Should coaches be able to create and manage profile pages for their school and/or team (like as a unit/group)?
		* another answer

9.  Do you want a way for coaches to communicate with their athletes via the app?
		* another answer

10. Would you like a way to aggregate/access team/school statistics, so that visitors and coaches can view those as well as individual athletes?
	* 


<br><br>

### Interviews

(we “interviewed” ourselves, acting as both roles; and discussed among ourselves)

<br><br>

### Other Elicitation Activities?


<br><br><hr>



## List of Primary Needs and Features

1. They want a nice looking site, with a clean light modern style, images that evoke swimming and competition.  (More like [Strava](https://www.strava.com/features) and less like [Athletic.net](https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Division/Event.aspx?DivID=100004&Event=14))  It should be easy to find the features available for free and then have an obvious link to register for an account or log in.  It should be fast and easily navigable.  

<br>

2. The general public will be able to view all results (just the race distance, type and time).  These are public events and the results should be freely available.  They should be able to search by athlete name, team, coach or possibly event date and location.  Not sure if they want to be able to filter or drill down as Athletic.net does.  They're not trying to organize by state, school, etc. Athletes are athletes and it doesn't matter where they're competing.  This is completely general, but only for swimming.

<br>

3. Logins will be required for viewing statistics and all other advanced features.  We eventually plan to offer paid plans for accessing these advanced features.  They'll be free initially and we'll transition to paid plans once we get people hooked.

<br>

4. Admin logins are needed for entering new data.  Only employees and contractors will be allowed to enter, edit or delete data.

<br>

5. "Standard" logins are fine.  Use email (must be unique) for username and then require an 8+ character password.  Will eventually need to confirm email to try to prevent some forms of misuse.  Admins and contractors must have an offline confirmation by our employees and then the "super" admin adds them manually.

<br>

6. The core entity is the athlete.  They are essentially free agents in the system.  They can be a member of one or more teams at one time, then change at any time.  Later when we want to have teams and do predictive analysis we'll let the coaches assemble their own teams and add/remove athletes from their rosters.

<br>

7. The first stats we want are: 1) display PR's prominently in each race event, 2) show a historical picture/plot of performance, per race type and distance, 3) some measure of how they rank compared to other athletes, both current and historical, 4) something that shows how often they compete in each race event, i.e. which events are they competing in most frequently, and alternately, which events are they "avoiding"

<br>

8.  The secondary entity is the coach.  They should be able to access each of their athletes, and eventually assemble teams, and also a profile page to represent their team and/or school.  These pages should have links to each of their athlete’s profile pages, as well as links so the coach can easily view all stats for their athletes.  Also to add/edit/delete swimmers from their team.

<br>

9. The ternary entity is the team or school.  A coach should be able to set up a profile page for his or her team, in part for recruitment efforts -- and of course for bragging rights if applicable.

<br>

### Other Modeling


<br><br><hr><hr>



## Identify Non-Functional Requirements

1. User accounts and data must be stored indefinitely.  They don't want to delete; rather, mark items as "deleted" but don't actually delete them.  They also used the word "inactive" as a synonym for deleted.

<br>

2. Passwords should not expire

<br>

3. Site should never return debug error pages.  Web server should have a custom 404 page that is cute or funny and has a link to the main index page.

<br>

4. All server errors must be logged so we can investigate what is going on in a page accessible only to Admins.

<br>

5. English will be the default language.

< br>

6. Athlete profiles and data should be stored indefinitely for historical purposes, for both individual athletes and team/school records.

<br>

7. Users should have the option for the site/app to “remember” them and an option stay logged in unless they specifically log out.

<br>

8. Implement a way for users to recover lost/forgotten usernames/passwords.
