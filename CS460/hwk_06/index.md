### Step 1 [setup]:  
we'll be using an existing database for this one... 

we'll be using SQL Server's example database, called "World Wide Importers" -- this db represents a wholesale novelty goods importer/distributor, which operates from the San Fran Bay area (the crap by the bay!)  

see Lab Sheet for more...

### Step 2 [setup - more]:  
* follow the steps shown in class (also linked from the lab insructions) to create a MVC project (same template we've been using)... 

* add the database... 

* reverse-engineer (generate) model classes

the backup file has several "archive" tables -- we don't want those, so just pick the tables that don't have "archive" in the name... 

neither do we need the db views... Dr. Morse says he ended up with 31 model classes... 


**be sure to move your DbContext class over into a DAL folder!**

### Step 6 [portfolio content]:
> Do you know what would make your grader really happy?  A video demo'ing your website.  **In fact, for this one it is mandatory you make a video**  
You can put it on your `public_html` or `P:` drive, -OR-, upload it to YouTube (if private be sure to include link, or share with `morses@mail.wou.edu`)
