### Step 0 [experimenting]:
So before I did anything else, I wanted to play around with branching - making a branch, 'checkout'ing the branch, and then merging the branch.

To do this, I made a repo called 'exp' and a branch in there called 'working'.

First, I had to be reminded that you can NOT create/start a repo on your Github directly from the command line -- you have to go into Github and make it via the GUI, and then you can do what you want with it from the command line.   [=

So once i did that, it was easier.  I just had to review some of the basic commands, since it had been a couple/few weeks since I'd last done some Github stuff.  (and remember how to 'cd' in the Git bash -- haha!)

Here's the steps I took, plus what it ended up looking like on Github:

I could swear I remember typing (including in CS407MA, Fall '18):
```
git add -a
```
but i got this:

I also found out this works:

By the way, that message is explained <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=git+warning%3A+LF+will+be+replaced+by+CRLF" target="_blank">here</a>.

So then I proceeded thusly:

(i left out all the stuff before I remembered/figured out that, duh, you gotta make your repo on the Github site, not via command line)

So it appears to be working up to here!  woo-hoo!
Now for some other playing around to see what happens..... 

---
btw, doing cd in my Git Bash looks like this:

*(don't worry, i'll memorize it or better yet figure out how to get it to start there in the first place!)*
