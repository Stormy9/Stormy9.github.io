### Step 1 [setup]:  
begin by creating a new, empty `MVC` project  
make sure your repo has the VS `.gitignore` file!  
    *(this is so `git` will ignore all temp build files + built binary files)*  

<br>

---
---
### Step 2 [planning]:  
implement the following *features* into one or more feature `branches`... merge each into `master` when finished  

better yet --> try implementing two parts of what is below, in two different feature `branch`es -- don't merge them back in to `master` until **both** of them are done..... 

this way you can see more of what it will be like with two or more developers working on the code/repo at the same time, and get (more) practice with `merge` conflicts.   [=

### Step 4 [more content & coding]:

### Step 5 [yet more content & coding]:

### Step 6 [requirements - video]:  

<br>

---
---
### Step 7 [turn it in]:  
`merge` your feature `branch`es back into `master` -- `push` everything to your repo for homework 4    

<br>

---
---
### Step 8 [portfolio content]:  
be sure to do screenshots -- or a video -- to prove that what you did is working!   [=  

> Now that we're into ASP.NET MVC, there's a lot more code in your project... we don't want it all on your blog/portfolio -- just the code **you** write... just include it as snippets, with good explanations in between!  

make sure everything is in repo!
