# homework one
the assignment instructions are <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html" target="_blank">here</a>...   

### Step 1 [setup]: 
* I'd already installed Git, for Fall '18 / CS407MA  -- but I updated my version   
   * In that class, I also learned how to *use* Git -- via Github, and about 99% was from the command line (on a Linux system)   
   * I got *lots* of practice using Git & Github from the command line in that class!  I got pretty comfortable with it -- for the basic common stuff, anyway but I did refresh myself on it with the tutorials I found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/resources/resources.html "excellent CS460 resources") and just googling some additional things I thought of.

* Got github repo set up for CS460 -- and synched locally, so I'll be all ready to start developing
    * with sub-directory/repos for each homework to come   
       **it looks like this on Github:**

       **and this from Github Desktop:**

       **and this from VisualStudio Code:**

### Step 2 [more setup]:
* Obviously, I already had a github account (:
* I went ahead and set up my Bitbucket account now   
   [my bitbucket account/repo](https://bitbucket.org/Stormy9/ "my bitbucket account")   
   * I even got this set up:
      [my bitbucket.io site](https://stormy9.bitbucket.io/ "my bitbucket.io site")   
      I mean, i know there's nothing to speak of there, yet, but i should be able to figure that out okay

### Step 3 [content/coding]:
So i'm doing my multi-page, hyperlinked website on games our family has fun playing... like board & card games.   

BUT... I had to learn bootstrap first -- plus refresh myself on html & css.   

I'd learned -- and gotten in a *lot* of practice -- with html & css while completing my CIS degree at Chemeketa... but have barely used it since I graduated in the Summer of 2017.  I've been so busy learning so many new things in my first two years at WOU -- like Java, Data Structures, Algorithms, and lots of stuff in Microservice Architectures.  And other stuff.   

This part was actually fun.  That's not to say that Steps 1 & 2 *weren't* fun... but this was *more* fun.  (:

### Step 4 [test]:

### Step 5 [even more setup]:
This is the part about making a repo on GitHub + enabling your GitHub Pages.   
After some googling around, I found that since I have an existing GitHub account, all I had to do to enable my GitHub pages, was to create a specially-named new repo in it.   

At first I tested it with an `.html` page, but then after investigating the sample pages referenced in the assignment instructions, went with `.md` pages, using one of the GitHub/Jekyll themes.  For one thing, it was easier & faster... for another thing, the practice making stuff with markdown was cool (I had very minimal practice with it til now).  And even Dr. Morse made his GitHub Page that way.  (:   

I mean, you could have it be in `.html`... that worked and all... but I went with `.md`.

I set up my GitHub Page loosely following the examples, taking a little from here and a little from there for inspiration -- and also following the instructions, of course.  

[Here's a link to the front page](https://stormy9.github.io/ "my github pages front page")   

[Here's some sources I used to learn/refresh/practice markdown-ing](https://stormy9.github.io/markdown/ "my markdown notes page")

### Step 6 [portfolio content]:
As you can see, I've been doing this one all along here.  (:   

---

### Step 7 [turn it in]:
I will.  (:   

---

### Step 8 [collection of notes/references + cheat-sheets + code snippets + etc]:
So I haven't started actually putting all of the above in there... BUT... I *do* have everything in place to do so... see?
