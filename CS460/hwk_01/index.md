# homework one
the assignment instructions are <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html" target="_blank">here</a>   
the repository to the main part of the assignment, found in Step 3, is <a href="https://github.com/Stormy9/CS460/tree/master/hwk_01" target="_blank">here</a>   
and <a href="https://Stormy9.github.io/CS460/hwk_01/games/" target="_blank">here</a> is the multi-page/hyperlinked site i made to practice HTML/CSS & Bootstrap (see Step 3).   


### Step 1 [setup]: 
* I'd already installed Git, for Fall '18 / CS407MA  -- but I updated my version   
   * In that class, I also learned how to *use* Git -- in connection with Github, and about 99% of that use was from the command line (on a Linux system)   
   
   * I got *lots* of practice using Git & Github from the command line in that class!  I got pretty comfortable with it -- for the basic common stuff, anyway... but I did refresh myself on it with the tutorials I found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/resources/resources.html" target="_blank">here</a> and by just googling some additional thoughts and questions I came up with.  I gathered all the stuff I liked best, <a href="https://stormy9.github.io/CS460/references/git/" target="_blank">here</a>.

* Got github repo set up for CS460 -- and synched locally, so I'll be all ready to start developing
    * with sub-directory/repos for each homework to come   

       **it looks like this on Github:**

       **and here's locally via Git Bash:**

### Step 2 [more setup]:
* Obviously, I already had a github account (:   

* I went ahead and set up my Bitbucket account now   
   <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Stormy9/" target="_blank">my bitbucket account/repo</a>      
   * I even got this set up:
      <a hfre="https://stormy9.bitbucket.io/" target="_blank">my bitbucket.io site</a>   
      Yeah, i know there's nothing to speak of there, yet, but i should be able to figure that out okay

### Step 3 [content/coding]:
So i'm doing my multi-page, hyperlinked website on games our family has fun playing... like board & card games.   

BUT... I had to learn bootstrap first -- plus refresh myself on html & css.   

I'd learned -- and gotten in a *lot* of practice -- with html & css while completing my CIS degree at Chemeketa... but have barely used it since I graduated in the Summer of 2017.  I've been so busy learning so many new things in my first two years at WOU -- like Java, Data Structures, Algorithms, and lots of stuff in Microservice Architectures.  And other stuff.   

This part was actually fun.  That's not to say that Steps 1 & 2 *weren't* fun... but this was *more* fun.  (:

---

### Step 4 [test]:
The test to which this refers, is to test if the stuff you do in Step 3 will work from anywhere.....
I will test all that when I finish Step 3.  (:

---

### Step 5 [even more setup]:
This is the part about making a repo on GitHub + enabling your GitHub Pages.   

After some googling around, I found that since I have an existing GitHub account, all I had to do to enable my GitHub pages, was to create a specially-named new repo in it like so: `username.github.io`   

At first I tested it out with an `.html` page, and that worked just fine and all..... but after investigating the sample pages referenced in the assignment instructions, I opted to go with `.md` pages, using one of the GitHub/Jekyll themes.   

For one thing, it was easier & faster to make them... for another thing, the practice making pages with markdown was cool -- I had very minimal practice with it til now.  And, hey -- even Dr. Morse made his GitHub Page that way.  (:   

I set up my GitHub Portfolio loosely following the examples, borrowing a little from here and a little from there for inspiration -- and also following the instructions, of course, and putting my own twist on it.  

[Here's a link to the front page](https://stormy9.github.io/ "my github pages front page")   

[Here's some sources I used to learn/refresh/practice markdown-ing](https://stormy9.github.io/CS460/references/markdown/ "my markdown notes page")   

---

### Step 6 [portfolio content]:
As you can see, I've been doing this one all along here.  (:   

---

### Step 7 [turn it in]:
I will.  (:   

---

### Step 8 [collection of notes/references + cheat-sheets + code snippets + etc]:
So I haven't started actually putting all of the above in there... BUT... I *do* have everything in place to do so... see?
