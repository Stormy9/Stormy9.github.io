# homework one
the assignment instructions are <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html" target="_blank">here</a>   
the repository to the main part of the assignment, found in Step 3, is <a href="https://github.com/Stormy9/CS460/tree/master/hwk_01" target="_blank">here</a>   
and <a href="https://Stormy9.github.io/CS460/hwk_01/games/" target="_blank">here</a> is the multi-page/hyperlinked site i made to practice HTML/CSS & Bootstrap (see Step 3).   


### Step 1 [setup]: 
* I'd already installed Git, for Fall '18 / CS407MA  -- but I updated my version   
   * In that class, I also learned how to *use* Git -- in connection with Github, and about 99% of that use was from the command line (on a Linux system)   
   
   * I got *lots* of practice using Git & Github from the command line in that class!  I got pretty comfortable with it -- for the basic common stuff, anyway... but I did refresh myself on it with the tutorials I found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/resources/resources.html" target="_blank">here</a> and by just googling some additional thoughts and questions I came up with.  I gathered all the stuff I liked best, <a href="https://stormy9.github.io/CS460/references/git/" target="_blank">here</a>.

* Got github repo set up for CS460 -- and synched locally, so I'll be all ready to start developing
    * with sub-directory/repos for each homework to come   

       **it looks like this on Github:**

       **and here's locally via Git Bash:**

       Although I'm not sure if it is best to have all my CS460 repos there, or organized into my Stormy9.github.io repo, or both... I'll figure it out though.

### Step 2 [more setup]:
* Obviously, I already had a github account (:   

* I went ahead and set up my Bitbucket account now   
   <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Stormy9/" target="_blank">my bitbucket account/repo</a>      
   * I even got this set up:
      <a href="https://stormy9.bitbucket.io/" target="_blank">my bitbucket.io site</a>   
      Yeah, i know there's nothing to speak of there, yet, but i should be able to figure that out okay

### Step 3 [content/coding]:
So i'm doing my multi-page, hyperlinked website on games our family has fun playing... like board & card games.   

BUT... I had to learn bootstrap first -- plus refresh myself on HTML & CSS.   

To do that, I went to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">the official Bootstrap page</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp" target="_blank"> W3Schools</a>.

While at Chemeketa, W3Schools had been strongly recommended to us to augment our learning and get in some hands-on practice for html, css, JavaScript, Ajax, php, etc., and I'd always liked their format and interactive trying things out, plus how you can quickly refer to any section you want for a little memory jogging.  So I went there again for this!

<a href="https://medium.com/quick-code/top-tutorials-to-develop-responsive-websites-using-bootstrap-4-c934172f3ebd" target="_blank">This article on Medium.com</a> has some good recommmendations on learning and practicing Bootstrap, too.

I noticed everywhere had the option of Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4..... I went with Bootstrap 4 -- hope I picked right.  Or at least that it won't make much of a difference.  haha!


I'd learned -- and gotten in a *lot* of practice -- with HTML & CSS while completing my CIS degree at Chemeketa... but have barely used it since I graduated in the Summer of 2017.  I've been so busy learning so many new things in my first two years at WOU -- like Java, Data Structures, Algorithms, and lots of stuff in Microservice Architectures.  And other stuff.   

However, as I recall, neither HTML nor CSS were very difficult or confounding or anything like that -- sometimes perhaps a bit annoying to get your CSS just how you wanted, but not that bad..... and, I distinctly remember having fun with both!  (:

But again, for a refresher and to play around with it to get acclimated again, I went to W3Schools for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a>.

The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network - HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network - CSS</a> sites recommended on Dr. Morse's site are also awesome -- easy to navigate and learn from, full of well-organized important stuff.   

For CSS, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a> is also a very good resource... for HTML, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/" target="_blank">HTML: The Living Standard</a> is pretty cool, too.

This part was actually fun.  That's not to say that Steps 1 - 2 plus 4-8 *weren't* fun... but this was, I think, the *most* fun.  (:

---

### Step 4 [test]:
The test to which this refers, is to test if the stuff you do in Step 3 will work from anywhere.....
I will test all that when I finish Step 3.  (:

---

### Step 5 [even more setup]:
This is the part about making a repo on GitHub + enabling your GitHub Pages.   

After some googling around, I found that since I have an existing GitHub account, all I had to do to enable my GitHub pages, was to create a specially-named new repo in it like so: `username.github.io`   

At first I tested it out with an `.html` page, and that worked just fine and all..... but after investigating the sample pages referenced in the assignment instructions, I opted to go with `.md` pages, using one of the GitHub/Jekyll themes.   

For one thing, it was easier & faster to make them... for another thing, the practice making pages with markdown was cool -- I had very minimal practice with it til now.  And, hey -- even Dr. Morse made his GitHub Page that way.  (:   

I set up my GitHub Portfolio loosely following the examples, borrowing a little from here and a little from there for inspiration -- and also following the instructions, of course, and putting my own twist on it.  

[Here's a link to the front page](https://stormy9.github.io/ "my github pages front page")   

[Here's some sources I used to learn/refresh/practice markdown-ing](https://stormy9.github.io/CS460/references/markdown/ "my markdown notes page")   

---

### Step 6 [portfolio content]:
As you can see, I've been doing this one all along here.  (:   

---

### Step 7 [turn it in]:
I will.  (:   

---

### Step 8 [collection of notes/references + cheat-sheets + code snippets + etc]:
So I haven't started actually putting all of the above in there... BUT... I *do* have everything in place to do so... see?
