## basic template for an **html5** page  
### with explanations in the comments  
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="eng">

    <head>
        <title>template</title>
        
        <link href="template.html">
        
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        
        <style>
        </style>
        
        <script>
        </script>
        
    </head>
<!----------------------------------------->
    <body>

        <header>header goes here</header>
        
        <nav>navigation</nav>
        
        <main>main
            <p id="demo">the id=demo paragraph
            </p>
        </main>
        
        <footer>footer</footer>
    
    </body>    
    
</html>
```
__note:__ `<head>` and `<header>` are **NOT** the same tag!

## html5 includes  
Holy freaking shite!  
One would think this would be something relatively easy and straight-forward, like including `css` and `js` files in your `html`... especially with `HTML5`... but ***no***.  

Several ways I discovered via Googling require using various libraries, which I didn't think would work in this scenario -- using markdown pages and GitHub sites.  

A few ways I found, though, were more straight-forward... involving `JavaScript` &/or `jQuery`.  

Of course, the **easiest**, and **most** straight-forward way -- that I learned at Chemeketa -- involves `php`, which does not work with GitHub sites.  

The one I used was simply the `JavaScript document.write()` way...
