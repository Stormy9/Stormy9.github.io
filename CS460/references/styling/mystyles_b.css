this css file is just to test/play with the cascading
feature -- if it's linked in the html pages

whatever is in here, should over-ride what is in there!

/*=============================================*/
/*
so doing li.nav_li works, to make the color crimson..... 
BUT -- then the hover color change-to-purple doesn't work!
*/
/*li.nav_li {
    color: #bb1133;

okay..... so *this* is NOT working, to set the color
    of just-plain-links to crimson!!!

NOTE:
it does not work when i set color to crimson
    in mystyles_a.css, either!
        so... wtf??
            why does css have to be so f'ing weird??

NOTE:  
it *DOES* render correctly in VSCode Preview!!
    just not when you push & view online for reals
        the hover-purple works online --

HEY!!  *this* here, *DOES* work!!  it over-rides
    mystyles_a.css -- or at least augments it, 
        as it's intended to do!

/*
so what is the take-away from this?
    i'm not sure.....   [=
*/
/*
Okay... so css is really f'ing weird...
    for this font-size-increase-on-hover...
    it *does* work as expected when pushed online...
        BUT... it does *NOT* render correctly in VSCode Preview!!
            it changes size on hover, all right... 
            but no longer turns purple along with that...
                online, it turns purple *AND* get bigger... 
                    (but the just-plain-link is still not red online
                     but is on VSCode Preview... *sigh*)
