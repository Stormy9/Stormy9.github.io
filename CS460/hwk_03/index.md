### Step 1 [setup]:  
get Visual Studio IDE downloaded & setup... the Community/free version is fine  

<br>

---
---
### Step 2 [more setup]:  
download the `.java` file that you are to translate  

<br>

---
---
### Step 3 [planning & design]:  
replicate -- aka __translate__ -- the `.java` program into `C#`  

write a `C#` console app __from scratch__ that does __exactly__ what the `.java` version does

__DO NOT COPY/PASTE THE CODE!!  Type it in and translate it as you go.  DO NOT COPY, PASTE, then try to fix errors!!!__

<br>

---
---
### Step 4 [content & coding]:  
be sure to use Visual Studio's `.gitignore` file!!

Per Dr. Morse's instructions:  
> As with the last homework, __all work for this homework should be done in a new feature branch with multiple commits over time.__
