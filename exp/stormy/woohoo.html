            <p class="text">In the seven terms I've attended Chemeketa for my current degree, I made President's List for five of them... the Dean's List for one (because of a 'B' in MTH111)... and only Honor Roll for the remaining term (WR121 was tough for me, but I passed with a 'C').</p>
        
            <p class="text">For my current degree program, my GPA is 3.867.  The student account section of the Chemeketa website insists on combining my GPA from this degree with the last one, which throws things off a little; but that's my GPA this time according to my calculations.</p>
            
                        <!-- DIVIDE 'QUALITY POINTS' by 'GPA HOURS'...  -->
            
            <p class="text">I did a lot better this time around, compared to when I attended Chemeketa to earn my first degree.  As it turns out, attending class regularly and turning in your assignments - on time or at all - has quite an effect on that type of thing.  But, I was 19 then; and still managed to graduate with a low 'B' average.</p>
            
            <p class="text">This time around, I truly wanted to be here, to be doing exactly what I was doing; my whole attitude about learning had changed and I really want to expand my horizons and understand new things that I'd long wanted to understand more thoroughly.</p>

            <p class="text">Theoretically, I'm supposed to be pretty smart.  Or so I've been told ever since Daddy discovered I could read the newspaper just after I turned three.  (<em style="font-size: .8em">In practicality, however, that's often up for debate.</em>)  The early years of school could be incredibly boring, especially having to wait for everyone else to learn reading, writing, and math; plus all kinds of things I naively thought everyone just knew already.  So I'd get in trouble for not paying attention and/or trying to talk to whoever was sitting next to me.</p>
            
            <p class="text">Thank God these classes at Chemeketa were so challenging, interesting, engaging, and often outright fun!  Even the math classes - math wasn't required for my first Chemeketa degree, and I didn't particularly care for or about it in high school; now, however, I find it fascinating and I want to learn &amp; understand it better.  That these are all things I genuinely want to learn about, need to learn about; along with instructors who make everything just that much better; makes all the difference.</p>
                
            <p class="text">So I'm looking forward to heading out to Western Oregon University, come fall; although a little nervous... I've never been to university, and I will finally be doing something seriously challenging!  That, however, will make it interesting.</p>
            
            <p class="text">As an aside, I really do like making lists and charts and diagrams, and spreadsheets and databases and things like that... it really is fun, to me.  Crafting webpages is awesome, too... especially once you start adding the CSS to things, styling all that just-plain-text all kinds of different ways... then add some functionality with scrpting languages to make your webpages actually do stuff.</p>
