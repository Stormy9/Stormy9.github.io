        <h2> welcome to my e-portfolio!</h2>
    
        <p>As you might have deduced by now, my name is Tricia.</p>
        <p>I've lived in Salem my entire life, and am a 3rd-generation Oregonian, as well as a 3rd-generation American... my great-grandparents were from Norway.  My grandparents settled in Silverton.  My Dad has done genealogy since 1956, so I know a lot about my background.  I built his database, and he's got records on over 16,000 relatives (living and dead).</p>
        
        <p>I ended up at Chemeketa because... </p>

        <p>I will soon be graduating with an Associate of Science degree in Computer Information Systems, with a certificate in Web Development.  The classes that were the most fun, were any of the ones about web design/development, any kind of programming, and the database ones.  Linux was cool too.  By the time I got to the last term withnNetworking-related classes, that ended up being not so bad.</p>
        
        <p>In the Fall of 2017, I'll be transferring to Western Oregon Univeristy to earn the Applied Baccalaureate in Computer Science.  That is something I never thought I could or would ever do, for a variety of reasons... but, off I'll go.</p>

<hr>        
<p>All eportfolios should have an About Me page. Without identification, the content and reflection can't be associated with you. Let's face it, writing a brief bio is a pain. What do you include? How do you keep it from revealing too much about you? Where do you start? </p>

<p>Here is one option for creating an about me page: </p>        
<p>Title your page, "Five Facts About Me" and bullet point or number five facts that highlight your strengths, character, interests, and leadership abilities. Vary the five facts to cover different areas of your life. You don't have to reveal too much about yourself; keep it generic and creative.</p>
        
<p>Question Prompts - to get your started </p>
