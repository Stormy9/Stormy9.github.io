                                                I graduated with an Applied Baccalaureate of Science in Computer Science from Western Oregon University on 
                                                June 13th, 2020.  We spent our entire senior year in Software Engineering I, II, & III; working in assigned teams 
                                                on a comprehensive software design and development project from inception through construction & delivery, in 
                                                preparation for joining a professional development team in a meaningful way.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                That Senior\Capstone project showed me just how fulfilling it is to work at creating software\web applications 
                                                that are smoothly functional & responsive, intuitive and enjoyable for the user, plus aesthetically appealing.  
                                                Equally important, it showed me just how much I loved collaborating with my team-mates and interacting with our 
                                                faculty advisor, who acted as Product Owner (among other roles).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Team Nerdvana had a lot of fun together working on our project, Petopia, even when we were up against challenges; 
                                                genuinely enjoyed one another’s company, and always had each other’s backs.  What had been “homework” turned into 
                                                something fun, that I genuinely looked forward to every day.  It was also fun interacting with classmates on 
                                                other teams, sharing technical help as well as moral support!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Now, I'm excited to find my place in the workforce where I can once again be part of a sharp, tight, enthusiastic, 
                                                dogged team; that knows how to have fun and get along -- just like Team Nerdvana.  I can’t wait to be part of a 
                                                development team again, working on bringing the coolest web-based applications and/or other software to life -- 
                                                working on engineering, coding, or preferably both.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I’ve found that I especially like working on the user interface, making things nice: smoothly responsive; 
                                                cleanly functional, doing everything the user needs and wants; intuitive to navigate and use; and that makes 
                                                the user happy just to look at and be there -- that robustly fulfills the project vision and mission.  
                                                That said, with my organizing dynamic, I enjoy working on database development too!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Throughout my college career, I have been taught -- or picked up on the fly -- a number of languages, frameworks, 
                                                and development tools... and more importantly, how to figure new things out, solving whatever challenge comes up 
                                                in the development process.  I learn most quickly working with someone who’s already experienced, experimenting 
                                                with working examples; but quickly fly on my own once getting the lay of the land!

                                            I have pretty strong skills in front-end web development <i>(HTML\CSHTML + Razor, CSS, JavaScript\jQuery +

                                            I’m also pretty good with SQL\T-SQL and relational databases, over two database courses; and have worked with 
                                            noSQL databases on a few occasions in various classes as well.  
                                            Several projects had us working with API’s, and in a couple instances building our own practice API’s.

                                            During Senior Sequence plus some previous classes, I became pretty comfortable using Git(Hub) via Bash, and we 
                                            used Pivotal Tracker to plan and track our Senior Project following Agile Engineering methodologies.  
                                            I also wrote quite a few earlier projects in Java, especially for Data Structures and Algorithms; and while 
                                            at Chemeketa learned and did projects using the LAMP stack.

                                        This is my second time around with college, but my first at the university level; finally earning a degree in 
                                        what I should have been doing all along.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A little more <i>(ahem)</i> experienced than some of my classmates, I didn’t grow up with computers or the 
                                        internet\web as a given part of daily life.  
                                        We got our first computer (an Apple IIe!) when I was 11... internet access when I was 24.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I’ve always felt like this gives me a somewhat altered — and awesome — perspective, compared to my classmates..... 
                                        I still have a kind of a “sense of wonder” about things that, to them, have nearly always been ubiquitous.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I'm so happy I finally took the fork in the road that led to my Computer Science degree — I’ve finally found 
                                        something I can happily work at for the rest of my life.  Software development is an avocation that I want 
                                        as my vocation as well!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While enjoying the entire journey, it was during the Software Engineering Senior Sequence that I realized a 
                                        shift had occured... homework was no longer <i>just</i> homework — not just a means to a grade, or a degree — 
                                        it was something I genuinely enjoyed and looked forward to getting back into after breaks for family, friends, 
                                        pets, and things like sleeping and doing the dishes.   [=

                                        The best parts of the whole experience was interacting with them while bringing our project vision to life.  
                                        Don’t get me wrong — I love our project too….. but the whole thing was made so much better by experiencing 
                                        everything with my team, as part of them.  I also had fun interacting with classmates on other teams as we 
                                        shared technical experiences and moral support.

                                            Note:  At this point, Petopia was incomplete! Due to the global pandemic, with all classes (and pretty much everything else!) going 
                                            remote\online with Zoom and all the other tools at our disposal... instead of presenting live at AES on May 28th, everyone had to
                                            prepare a video presentation by May 12th. <br><br> 
                                            So... we transformed from up-and-coming software engineers to videographers for a week to get these presentations ready on time!  
                                            Even though we were a bit disappointed that our project was not complete, being almost four weeks ahead of our target completion date 
                                            when we took a week off to produce our demonstration... Team Nerdvana had a lot of fun together making our video and feel like we were 
                                            able to show the heart and soul of Petopia, along with our affinity for the project.

                                            We only wish we had another couple of sprints to add in some additional fun features we had initially envisioned — "friends",

                                            However, development hasn't fully ended with graduation; as Petopia is something that we want to continue with on a part-time basis.  
                                            We enjoy working on it, enjoy working with each other, and in so doing, continue to develop skills.

                                                    My Dad started his genealogy project in 1956, inheriting some tree drawings &amp; family records from some elder family members to get him started. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    A draftsman &amp; map-maker by trade -- he also taught drafting &amp; math to inmates at Oregon State Correctional Institution for 20+ years -- 
                                                    Dad has completed many fully-hand-drawn family trees, along with accumulating a massive file of direct correspondance with relatives, compiling dozens 
                                                    of family albums, publishing a family genealogy newsletter for 20 years, and collecting data on over 16,000 relatives in a rudimentary database (using MSAccess).  
                                                    He also has a decent collection of family stories from their mother countries as well as when they were new immigrants to the United States.

                                                    The goal of our project is to convert Dad's database to MS-SQL Server, and create a web app around it.  From here, Dad, my cousins, and our dev team will 
                                                    have "admin access" to actually manipulate the database; but any family member can create an account, log in, find family records and their own spot in the family, 
                                                    and we also want to add interesting family statistics, family stories &amp; trivia, and other fun features.  
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    It will also be a means for family members to provide updated and/or corrected genealogical information, add family photos (hopefully we can collect more 
                                                    historical ones as well), and we hope contribute more family stories and histories -- I love reading &amp; knowing the stories of our ancestors.

                                                so, I made my own chances, my own opportunities, and started working for myself.

                                        <div style="font-size: 87%;">
                                            My doggies are my babies, yes..... but I don't think of them as my "children", like a lot of other dog lovers do.  
                                            No -- and no offense or anything -- but, they are dogs..... which are a lot better than kids anyway (haha!) and 
                                            exactly why I love them so much.  They are my beloved pets..... "pet" is a very special designation indeed.  [=
                                            <br><br>
                                            Seriously..... I enjoy dogs <b><i>because</i></b> they are dogs.  I don't <b><i>want</i></b> them to be anything else!  
                                            I enjoy that they are not people, with their little doggie characters &amp; personalities; and love my pets with all  
                                            my heart, all my soul, and every molecule of my being.  [=
                                            <br><br>
                                            I've had Shelties since 1983 when I was 10 -- and two or more Shelties at all times since 1985!  I did 4-H &amp; junior 
                                            handling plus doggie obedience trials while in junior high &amp; high school, and later showed in the breed ring too.  
                                            Between 1989 and 2008 I bred &amp; raised nine litters of Shelties -- raising those puppies were some of the best times 
                                            of my life.  [=
                                            <br><br>
                                            Before I could get into "Dog Sports" -- especially dog agility, which is what I <b><i>really</i></b> wanted to do -- my 
                                            spinal disability progressed to the point that became impossible.  =[  Around that time I "retired" from showing dogs at all.  
                                            <br><br>
                                            I also stopped raising Shelties, in 2008..... for one thing, it is expensive to do it "right", obtaining all the health 
                                            clearences, breeding fees, proper veterinary care, and so many other things.  For another thing, I realized that I was having 
                                            too difficult of a time adopting puppies out!  Don't get me wrong -- matching someone with their little Sheltie soul-mate 
                                            was awesome..... but, well, eventually I couldn't not bond with them too much, and when that 2008 litter came -- well, 
                                            I kept all five.  [=
                                            <br><br>
                                            Eventually, I returned to school to do what I really, always had wanted to do (see the 1st tab!)   
                                            My last five Shelties were always all around me while I did homework, always <b><i>so</i></b> happy to have me back 
                                            when I came home from school each day.  [=  They were my little furry cheerleaders, my little furry bff's, 
                                            my constant companions..... my little pets who were full of unconditional love &amp; acceptance, and every time 
                                            I looked at them brought me joy &amp; happiness -- looking into their sweet little eyes melted my heart.  [=
                                            <br><br>
                                            My "Baby Jack" left me first, in July of '18, right before my Discrete Math I final exam (I did a summer math intensive 
                                            course!)  Then "Princess Possum" went after a brief illness in February of '19.  (she was named that, because, as a 
                                            blue merle, when she was born, she had a silvery and white muzzle and a little pink nose, and everyone said "she looks 
                                            like a little baby possum!")  Then my "Ms. Zoey" left me in April '19, again after a brief illness.  
                                            <br><br>
                                            Perhaps not surprisingly, Winter term '19 saw my grades tank.  ]=  My elective that term (Anthropology, I think) I 
                                            just stayed with my "B"..... but my two CS courses, I was determined to re-take and improve my grades (I had, at least, 
                                            eked out a "C" in both).  After all, I had credit hours to fill before graduation, to continue my financial aid, and 
                                            not enough required courses left anyway -- it would save me from figuring out even more electives!  
                                            I re-took both CS classes, snagging an "A" in each.
                                            <br><br>
                                            "Mr. Sawyer" &amp; "Ms. Lacey" were with me all that last school summer and my whole senior year -- all through 
                                            Senior Sequence &amp; my awesome Senior\Capstone project with my awesome Team Nerdvana, and were with me at our 
                                            "virtual graduation" -- and all through the global pandemic lockdown. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            Mr. Sawyer, however, crossed the bridge in July '20, after a brief illness.  It was just me and Little Ms. Lacey left.  
                                            She was with me through the historic Oregon Fires in early September.  But, my heart shattered when my Ms. Lacey 
                                            followed her siblings in September '20, also after a brief illness. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            And now I find myself "Sheltie-less" for the first time since 1983!  I've had a hard time establishing a "new normal" 
                                            in life, and am even more anxious to get settled into my new career so that I can re-build my little Sheltie family.

                                            Family gatherings are my favorite times!  I enjoy spending time with my Daddy, step-mom Alyce, and my sister Jan plus her five kids 
                                            &amp; husband, my brother Mike, and my cousin\bff Cathy.  I also have a few close friends who I love hanging out with -- even though 
                                            some of them are out-of-state and our hanging out is limited to online or over the phone.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I made some new friends in school who I really liked hanging out with too, and working on projects together.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Our family especially enjoys playing games together -- and some of my friends do too, haha!  And I mean "old-school games" -- like 
                                            Monopoly, Dominos, Clue, Quiddler, Five Crowns, Mystify, Smart Ass, Qwirkle, Last Word, and various card games (especially Golf!)
                                            <br><br>
                                            Also I love making my home-made pizzas (crust, sauce, seasoned beef topping -- inspired by my Momma &amp; perfected over the course 
                                            of 20-ish years!) for birthdays, and doing the "big three" holiday dinners -- Christmas, Thanksgiving, &amp; Easter.  Our family also 
                                            has a two-day games-and-chow party for New Year's Eve &amp; New Year's Day.  And I continue the tradition of my Momma's side of the family, 
                                            that started somewhere around 1950 or so, of making "Funny-Face Hamburgers" every Halloween!
